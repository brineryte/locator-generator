# Locator Generator (version 1)
Google chrome extension that reads the current page and searches for sepcified elements, then uses those elements to output respective locators in a format for use with Selenium testing. 
The format is currently specific to my own python Selenium project. I'd like to make that format editable in future versions.

## Install the Extension:
1. Clone this git repo locally
1. Open Chrome
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
1. Enable Developer mode if not already enabled
1. Click 'Load Unpacked'
1. Select the cloned project folder (`locator-generator` by default)
1. Verify it is displayed in the list of extentions
